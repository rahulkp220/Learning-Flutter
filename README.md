#### Installing Flutter Locally

Google has a great documentation for installing flutter on any OS. Click on the link that clearly identifies your operating system.

- [Windows](https://flutter.io/setup-windows/)
- [Mac OS](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/)
- [Linux](https://flutter.io/setup-linux/)

#### IDE

I will be using VSCode for developing all my flutter apps. However, you can also use Android Studio for the same as well.
Here are the links to configure the IDEs.

- [Android Studio](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/#androidstudio)
- [VSCode](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/#vscode)
